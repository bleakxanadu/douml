Source the included setpath.sh shell script to configure your PATH
variable to allow you to run the application from this directory.

See the notes for use in the setpath.sh file.

Basic test sequence ---
(All performed from top of source tree)

make	 	(build app)
. setpath.sh 	(add paths to PATH)
./src/douml 	(run application)

Note that the PATH changes are effective ONLY within the open shell,
temporary, and do not affect your global PATH variable. You must
source setpath.sh once for any shell you want to test within.
