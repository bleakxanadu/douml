######  Notes from qt4port tree ######
Previously, bouml would install itself into /usr. I changed it
to install under /tmp, since its a place that is acessible and
it is suitable for volatile testing purposes. Calling make install
under this folder will compile and install bouml-ng and put the
results under /tmp. To execute, use /tmp/bin/bouml.

Thanks.

###### Notes for DoUML tree ######

NOTE: Installing to /tmp/... will not allow plugouts and tools to
work from within the bouml executable UNLESS you add those locations
to your PATH variable!

In this source tree I have retained the original /usr/bin and /usr/lib
install paths, but you should NOT run make install for testing.

Source the included setpath.sh shell script to configure your PATH
variable to allow you to run the application from this directory.

See the notes for use in the setpath.sh file.

Basic test sequence ---
(All performed from top of source tree)

make	 	(build app)
. setpath.sh 	(add paths to PATH)
./src/douml 	(run application)

Note that the PATH changes are effective ONLY within the open shell,
temporary, and do not affect your global PATH variable. You must
source setpath.sh once for any shell you want to test within.
